##What is Stock Talk:

    public reaction surrounding the rising or falling trades; and using the public opinion as an indicator, speculate on trends in the
    near future. Click on one of the biggest mover or use the search bar; you will be redirected to a details page that include live
    graphs, stocktwit, twitter, and reddit feeds about the company stock.
